# NMIMS BADM Hackthon 2019 - Energy Demand Forecasting for Power Industry
This project was made at Round- 2 of NMIMS Buisness Analytics and Data Mining(BADM) Championship. <br/>
Two datasets training and validation sets, along with case study notes were given.
Goal of the case study was to come up with project implementation methodology with tested models which gives best forecasted demands for power Industry using the historical training data for building model logic and validating on the hold-out set. <br/>
I cleaned the dataset, then changed the columns and got the features in the form, to which Linear Regression can be applied. After applying Linear regression, predictions on test dataset were made. An accuracy of 80% was achieved.
