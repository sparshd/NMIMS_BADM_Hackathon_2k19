This project was made at Round- 2 of NMIMS Buisness Analytics and Data Mining(BADM) Hackthon.
Two datasets training and validation sets, along with case study notes were given.
I cleaned the dataset using MS excel, then changed the columns and got the features in the form, to which Linear Regression can be applied. After applying Linear regression, predictions on test dataset were made. An accuracy of 80% was achieved.
